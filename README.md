🔬 Neural-Shape Analytics Hub (VisionDraft)Developer: Naveen N (22MIA1049)Course: Computer VisionLive Demo: https://naveen-visiondraft.streamlit.app/🚀 Project OverviewNeural-Shape Analytics Hub is a specialized Computer Vision application built to automate the identification and geometric analysis of various shapes. By leveraging OpenCV for image processing and Streamlit for the dashboard interface, this tool provides real-time feature extraction for industrial and academic research purposes.🧠 Technical FeaturesGeometric Classification: High-precision detection of Triangles, Squares, Rectangles, Circles, and complex Polygons.Feature Extraction: Generates data for every detected object, including:Side Count: Automated vertex calculation.Area ($px^2$): Surface area calculation.Perimeter ($px$): Boundary length.Circularity: A metric $(0.0 - 1.0)$ indicating how close a shape is to a perfect circle.Interactive Visual Insights: A "Quad-Plot" dashboard using Plotly to visualize data distribution and geometric correlations.Advanced Image Controls: Real-time adjustments for Binary Sensitivity (Thresholding), Contour Colors, and Line Thickness.Deliverable Export Hub: One-click downloads for:The processed analysis view.The binary computer vision mask.Full technical feature reports in CSV format.🛠️ Installation & Local SetupClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
